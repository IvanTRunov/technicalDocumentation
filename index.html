                        The smallest React example looks like this:
                    </p>

                    <code>
    ReactDOM.render(
      h1 Hello, world! h1,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
                </code>
                    <p>
                        It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once
                        you
                        master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list
                        of
                        all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can
                        access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. You can
                        learn
                        most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the
                        sidebar.
                        For example, “Introducing JSX” is the next chapter after this one.

                    <p>
                        Consider this variable declaration:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const element = h1 Hello, world! h1;
                </code>
                    <p>
                        This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React
                        to
                        describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes
                        with
                        the full power of JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section.
                        Below,
                        you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping
                        it in
                        curly braces:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const name = 'Josh Perez';
    const element = h1 Hello, {name} h1;

    ReactDOM.render(
      element,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
                </code>
                    <p>
                        You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2,
                        user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An element describes what you want to see on the screen:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const element = h1 Hello, world h1;
                </code>

                    <p>
                        Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React
                        DOM
                        takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or
                        attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain
                        point in
                        time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it
                        to
                        ReactDOM.render().
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider this ticking clock example:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    function tick() {
        const element = (
          div>
            h1 Hello, world! h1
            h2 It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}. h2
          div>
        );
        ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
        }
                      
    setInterval(tick, 1000);
                </code>
                    <p>
                        It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.
                    </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="4">

                <article>
                    <p>
                        Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called
                        “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    function Welcome(props) {
      return h1 Hello, {props.name} h1;
    }
                </code>
                    <p>
                        This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for
                        properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components
                        “function
                        components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const element = div />;
                </code>
                    <p>
                        However, elements can also represent user-defined components:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const element = Welcome name="Sara" />;
                </code>
                    <p>
                        When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and
                        children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    function Welcome(props) {
        return h1 Hello, {props.name} h1>;
      }
      
      const element = Welcome name="Sara" />;
      ReactDOM.render(
        element,
        document.getElementById('root')
      );
                </code>
                </article>

                <p>
                    Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have
                    only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:
                </p>
                <code>
    function tick() {
        const element = (
          div>
            h1 Hello, world! h1
            h2 It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}. h2
          div>
        );
        ReactDOM.render(
          element,
          document.getElementById('root')
        );
      }
      
      setInterval(tick, 1000);
            </code>
                <p>
                    In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It
                    will
                    set up its own timer and update itself every second.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:
                </p>
                <code>
    function Clock(props) {
        return (
          div
            h1 Hello, world! h1
            h2 It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}. h2
          div
        );
      }
      
      function tick() {
        ReactDOM.render(
           Clock date={new Date()} />,
          document.getElementById('root')
        );
      }
      
      setInterval(tick, 1000);
            </code>
                <p>You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a single empty method to it called render().
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Move the body of the function into the render() method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <code>
    class Clock extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return (
            div
              h1 Hello, world! h1
              h2 It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}. h2
            div
          );
        }
    }
            </code>
                <p>
                    Clock is now defined as a class rather than a function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render
                    Clock /> into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used. This lets
                    us
                    use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.

                        <li>
                            React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

                        <li>
                            With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For example, the HTML:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    button onclick="activateLasers()">
        Activate Lasers
    button>
                </code>
                    <p>
                        is slightly different in React:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    button onClick={activateLasers}>
        Activate Lasers
    button>
                </code>
                    <p>
                        Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You
                        must
                        call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default link
                        behavior
                        of opening a new page, you can write:
                    </p>

                        In React, this could instead be:

                    <code>
    function ActionLink() {
        function handleClick(e) {
          e.preventDefault();
          console.log('The link was clicked.');
        }
      
        return (
          a href="#" onClick={handleClick}>
            Click me

        );

                    <p>
                        Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript
                        operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state,
                        and
                        let React update the UI to match them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Consider these two components:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    function UserGreeting(props) {
        return h1 Welcome back! h1;
    }
      
    function GuestGreeting(props) {
        return h1 Please sign up. h1;
    }
                </code>
                    <p>
                        We’ll create a Greeting component that displays either of these components depending on whether
                        a
                        user is logged in:
                    </p>

                    <code>
    function Greeting(props) {
      const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
      if (isLoggedIn) {
        return UserGreeting />;
      }
      return GuestGreeting />;
    }
                  
    ReactDOM.render(
      Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
                </code>
                    <p>
                        This example renders a different greeting depending on the value of isLoggedIn prop.

                    <p>
                        Given the code below, we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their
                        values.
                        We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
    console.log(doubled);                    
                </code>
                    <p>
                        This code logs [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] to the console.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be
                        given
                        to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
      li key={number.toString()}>
        {number}
      /li>
    );
                </code>
                    <p>
                        The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its
                        siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
      li key={todo.id}>
        {todo.text}
      /li>
    );
                </code>
                    <p>
                        When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last
                        resort:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
      li key={index}>
        {todo.text}
      li>
    );                    
                </code>
                    <p>
                        We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively
                        impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Check out Robin Pokorny’s article
                        for
                        an in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key. If you choose not to
                        assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.

                <header>Forms</header>
                <article>
                    <code>
    form>
        label>
          Name:
          input type="text" name="name" />
        /label>
        input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      /form>
                </code>
                    <p>
                        This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the
                        form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to
                        have
                        a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that
                        the
                        user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called
                        “controlled
                        components”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In HTML, form elements such as 'input', 'textarea', and 'select' typically maintain their own
                        state
                        and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state
                        property
                        of components, and only updated with setState().
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React
                        component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.
                        An
                        input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled
                        component”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can
                        write
                        the form as a controlled component:
                    </p>
                    <code>
    class NameForm extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.state = {value: ''};
      
          this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
          this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
        }
      
        handleChange(event) {
          this.setState({value: event.target.value});
        }
      
        handleSubmit(event) {
          alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
          event.preventDefault();
        }
      
        render() {
          return (
            form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
              label>
                Name:
                input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
              label>
              input type="submit" value="Submit" />
            form
          );
        }
      }
                </code>
                    <p>
                        Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be
                        this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every
                        keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this
                        means
                        you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset
                        it
                        from other event handlers.
